# GenMeet: Bridge The Generational Gap

##### By Valentin Nguyen, Digital Humanities 110: UI/UX Design, Spring 2021

## Introduction
GenMeet is an app that is meant to "bridge the gap" by providing an opportunity to bring people from different generations together to have a conversation. The follow UI designs is of the homescreen, or the very first screen the user sees when opening the website.

The purpose of GenMeet is to create a visual prototype draft of one of the many tasks a user will have to perform when using the website. It is meant to cater towards users who have just found the website and navigates them through the process of making their own profile within the site.

## Design Statement

Through my UX design project, I hope to "bridge the gap" between multigenerational communities by offering an easy way for people in different generations to meet and get to know each other. This project will encourage conversations between people of different age groups and would allow for anyone, no matter how well-versed they are in technology, to accessbily use the service. It will hopefully serve people who are younger as well as others who are older, especially those who are local in the Los Angeles area, to become more interested in socializing with others despite the generation gap. 

This activity will satisfy the user's basic need for interpersonal skills. Especially now during the pandemic when it is difficult to meet new people, users can have the opportunity to meet other people regardless of where they are located. This also applies to the elderly, pandemic or not, who had gone through retirement and are in need to continue exercising their interpersonal skills.

Current solutions to satisfying this need for practicing social and interpersonal skills exist, but are not known unless the user is specifically looking for that particular kind of service. From my own observations, those services are not widely used among people my age. If they were interested in the topic, however, they would most likely go to a nursing home and ask to volunteer. However, this need can fulfill anyone, not only the ones that are interested in it in the first place.

Some limitations that to this activity that can be improved with technology is more awareness and accessbility for young people to meet with the elderly and vice versa. Technology would allow those interactions to happy more quickly and efficiently, and could also provide a safety barrier between the parties via the computer screen in case any of the users are uncomfortable with meeting new people in person.

| Presentation | Omegle is a free video chat website that allows people to socialize and connect with others. Users do not need to register or login to use the service, as it randomly and anonymously pairs users in private chat sessions. Omegle's aim is to connect people from all over, no matter where they are or who they are. Its homepage looks very outdated and has poor UI, but all the essential elements are there: social media buttons at the top righthand corner, a bar where the user can type in what their interests are, and a 'text' and 'video' option that the user can choose from. Additionally, there is a description of Omegle and what it is as well as an open terms of agreement at the bottom. | AmeriCorps is a federal agency that brings elders together to directly serving nonprofit organizations. Its mission is to strengthen communities and foster civic engagement through service and volunteering. It is mostly a site where seniors ages 55 and older can deliver acts of services such as collaborating with schools, responding to environmental disasters, combating housing and food insecurity, and more. At first glance, the homepage is clear and states program's mission straight away. The navigation bar is clearly at the top for easy access, and the overall site design has a distinct color scheme accompanied with enticing photos. |
| Overall Evaluation | Overall, Omegle has a lot of major usability issues that can leave any user, whether they are well-versed in technology or are new to technology, confused and unattracted to the site. Omegle's service has a lot of potential and many people know about it, but the website development itself could be improved so that it is more modern. | Overall, the AmeriCorps website is an aesthetic and ethically user-friendly website with easy navigation. There are only minor elements (such as the profile registration page) that needs to be more consistent with the rest of the website in general, but the majority of the site is accessible for anyone no matter what their level of technological ability is. |

### Usability Testing

After conducting heuristic evaliuations on my potential competitors, I realized multiple principles were being violated and wanted to look further into the Omegle website to see how my target audience would react to it. The goal of this experiment was to see if my usability test material was effective, and to also better understand the usability experience of the user.

This pilot usability test gave me a better understanding of the point of view from my target audience and made some points during the test that I had not realized before. To name a few points I learned:
- For the actual making of the usability test, I learned about how difficult it was to create tasks for a website that does not have many features. I, myself, had a hard time trying to figure out the different features of the site when finding tasks for the participant to do.
- I also learned that the moderator must have a lot of patience when watching the participant use the site, since I had already gone through the app and am more familiar with its features than the participant was. I found myself wanting to tell the participant how to perform their tasks, but had to remember to hold myself back and let them try to figure it out themselves. 
- Moreover, I learned how useful it is for the participant to talk and think aloud while they are doing their tasks, as it gives me verbal reassurance that I can understand what they're thinking as they go through the website.

## User Research
Summary and link to your assignment folder

After conducting the UT, I expanded my experiments with competing websites and sought to figure out how users look for information online about other useres. I set up a contextual inquiry, or participatory observation where I asked the participants questions about how they searched things up online.
