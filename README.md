# GenMeet: Bridge The Generational Gap

##### By Valentin Nguyen, Digital Humanities 110: UI/UX Design, Spring 2021

## Introduction
GenMeet is an app that is meant to "bridge the gap" by providing an opportunity to bring people from different generations together to have a conversation. The follow UI designs is of the homescreen, or the very first screen the user sees when opening the website.

The purpose of GenMeet is to create a visual prototype draft of one of the many tasks a user will have to perform when using the website. It is meant to cater towards users who have just found the website and navigates them through the process of making their own profile within the site.

## Clear design statement: 

Through my UX design project, I hope to "bridge the gap" between multigenerational communities by offering an easy way for people in different generations to meet and get to know each other. This project will encourage conversations between people of different age groups and would allow for anyone, no matter how well-versed they are in technology, to accessbily use the service. It will hopefully serve people who are younger as well as others who are older, especially those who are local in the Los Angeles area, to become more interested in socializing with others despite the generation gap. 

This activity will satisfy the user's basic need for interpersonal skills. Especially now during the pandemic when it is difficult to meet new people, users can have the opportunity to meet other people regardless of where they are located. This also applies to the elderly, pandemic or not, who had gone through retirement and are in need to continue exercising their interpersonal skills.

Current solutions to satisfying this need for practicing social and interpersonal skills exist, but are not known unless the user is specifically looking for that particular kind of service. From my own observations, those services are not widely used among people my age. If they were interested in the topic, however, they would most likely go to a nursing home and ask to volunteer. However, this need can fulfill anyone, not only the ones that are interested in it in the first place.

Some limitations that to this activity that can be improved with technology is more awareness and accessbility for young people to meet with the elderly and vice versa. Technology would allow those interactions to happy more quickly and efficiently, and could also provide a safety barrier between the parties via the computer screen in case any of the users are uncomfortable with meeting new people in person.
