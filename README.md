# GenMeet: Bridge The Gap

##### By Valentin Nguyen, Digital Humanities 110: UI/UX Design, Spring 2021

## Introduction
GenMeet is an app that is meant to "bridge the gap" by providing an opportunity to bring people from different generations together. Generation gaps are an inevitable phenomenon that happens naturally as cultures, trends, music genres, and language develop across eras. The youth might often hear elders being their phrases with, "Kids these days..." or, "When I was young..." The contrast between generations largely has to do with the advancement of technology. Although boomers (refered to those born between 1946 to 1964, whom are now between 58 to 65 years old as of 2021) use the Internet on a regular basis, Millenials (20 to 36 year olds) and younger generation are much more involved and technologically well-versed. 

The goal of GenMeet is to bridge the generational gap by being open to learning and understanding why these differences exist, and exploring new ways to communicate with others. It encourages users to learn how to communicate effectively and respectfully in a multi-generational environment, and leverage differences to build stronger relationships. This project will encourage conversations between people of different age groups and would allow for anyone, no matter how well-versed they are in technology, to accessbily use the service. It will hopefully serve people who are younger as well as others who are older, especially those who are local in the Los Angeles area, to become more interested in socializing with others despite the generation gap. 

## Design Statement

After a series of evaluation and testing, I found that I have noticed that users have a basic need for interpersonal skills. Especially now during the pandemic when it is difficult to meet new people, users can use GenMeet to have the opportunity to meet other people regardless of where they are located. This also applies to the elderly, pandemic or not, who had gone through retirement and are in need to continue exercising their interpersonal skills. From my own observations, those services are not widely used among people my age. 

Some limitations that to this activity that can be improved with technology is more awareness and accessbility for young people to meet with the elderly and vice versa. Technology would allow those interactions to happy more quickly and efficiently, and could also provide a safety barrier between the parties via the computer screen in case any of the users are uncomfortable with meeting new people in person.

## Competitor Analysis & Heuristic Evaluation

#### Omegle

<img width="500" alt="Omegle Homepage" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81778205/113912737-5578d880-9790-11eb-8510-a58beedb8e87.png">

I first conduced a heuristic evaluation on one of the most well-known video-chatting apps at the moment, Omegle. Omegle is a free video chat website that allows people to socialize and connect with others. Users do not need to register or login to use the service, as it randomly and anonymously pairs users in private chat sessions. Its homepage looks very outdated and has poor UI, but all the essential elements are there: social media buttons at the top righthand corner, a bar where the user can type in what their interests are, and a 'text' and 'video' option that the user can choose from.

Overall, Omegle has a lot of major usability issues that can leave any user, whether they are well-versed in technology or are new to technology, confused and unattracted to the site. Omegle's service has a lot of potential and many people know about it, but the website development itself could be improved so that it is more modern. 

#### AmeriCorps

Then, I conducted heurisitic evaluations on the AmeriCorps website, which is a federal agency that brings elders together to directly serving nonprofit organizations. It is mostly a site where seniors ages 55 and older can deliver acts of services such as collaborating with schools, responding to environmental disasters, combating housing and food insecurity, and more. At first glance, the homepage is clear and states program's mission straight away. The navigation bar is clearly at the top for easy access, and the overall site design has a distinct color scheme accompanied with enticing photos. 

Overall, the AmeriCorps website is an aesthetic and ethically user-friendly website with easy navigation. There are only minor elements (such as the profile registration page) that needs to be more consistent with the rest of the website in general, but the majority of the site is accessible for anyone no matter what their level of technological ability is.

## Usability Testing

After conducting heuristic evaliuations on my potential competitors, I realized multiple principles were being violated and wanted to look further into the Omegle website to see how my target audience would react to it. The goal of this experiment was to see if my usability test material was effective, and to also better understand the user's usability experience. This pilot usability test gave me a better understanding of the point of view from my target audience and made some points during the test that I had not realized before. To name a few points I learned:
- For the actual making of the usability test, I learned about how difficult it was to create tasks for a website that does not have many features. I, myself, had a hard time trying to figure out the different features of the site when finding tasks for the participant to do.
- I also learned that the moderator must have a lot of patience when watching the participant use the site, since I had already gone through the app and am more familiar with its features than the participant was. I found myself wanting to tell the participant how to perform their tasks, but had to remember to hold myself back and let them try to figure it out themselves. 
- Moreover, I learned how useful it is for the participant to talk and think aloud while they are doing their tasks, as it gives me verbal reassurance that I can understand what they're thinking as they go through the website.

## User Research & Contextual Inquiry

After conducting the UT, I expanded my experiments with competing websites and sought to figure out how users look for information online about other useres. I set up a contextual inquiry, or participatory observation where I asked the participants questions about how they searched things up online. The goal of this contextual inquirt was to

## UX Storytelling: Personas, Journey Maps, Scenarios

Based on my understanding of video-chatting app users, I developed two personas and scenarios that depicted the type of users that would use the GenMeet app, along with their typical interactions with the app.

## Wireframe, Graphic Design, & Low-fidelity Prototype

Before beginning prototype development, I began experimenting with different features that I wanted to incorporate into my app to make it more accessible and easy to use for my target users. I soon began my initial wireframes for my low-fidelity protoype based on the scenarios of my two personas. Based on user research, the following features seek to solve the common limitations of chatting online:

1. **User Verification Check** - ensures that users go through a thorough virtual background check to establish a strong sense of safety between users; creates a sense of safety for users when they use the app so that they know the chatting service is meant for serious, productive, and purposeful intentions rather than less serious intentions
2. **Help Page** - provides a list of commonly asked questions in regards to the legitimacy of the app as well as how to navigate it.
3. **Ease of Use** - provide accessible, convenient and usable flow throughout the app that minimizes the chance and possibility to confusion and frustration for the user through minimal text and effective design.

The puropse of this low-fidelty prototype is to test the functionality and flow of the features listed above, and to see how well it can be integrated into the current process of meeting other people. This will test whether the features I have designed work for people realistically, while also observing and inquiring them about the app and its features. The test will give me an opportunity to find solutions to making certain features better and more accessible through listening to their suggestions.

## Conclusion

Overall, I think aspects that were successful in making this prototype was keeping an aesthetic and minimalistic design throughout the whole process. It was tedious trying to create the extra screens that navigated the users in order to prevent errors on their end, but I think they were necessary because users will have to input their basic information. The overall purpose of the website is to bring people from different communities together, because that doesn't happen very easily or often. I think it comes with a lack of trust between different communities where people seem afraid or uninterested in cultures that aren't their own. In forcing the user to provide their information in addition to the phone number verification in the end, it will hopefully help users realize that everyone using the website had gone through the same extensive process. This ultimately makes sure that users feel safe when using the app and that they don't come across users that won't use the app for its intended purpose.

Things I would want to add or revise when editing my prototype:
- Change the screen sizes to fit a general phone instead.
- Allow the user to go back to the home screen by clicking on the top lefthand logo at any point during the process of creating their profile.
- Maybe the global font sizes smaller so that they are a more standard size for computers.
- Find an alternative way to display the "photo rules" to the user when they get to the part in the process of uploading their photo (e.g. make another button that leads them to another screen listing all the photo rules).
- Make the chevron "back button" arrow more noticeable by making it into more of a button than a shape on the screen (e.g. had a black square border around the arrow to make it look like a button).
- Maybe add a log-in feature on the home screen? The prototype at the moment is mainly for users that have never used the app before and have just launched the app.
